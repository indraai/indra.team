**[topic]** = Choose a desired topic of learning

## SUMMARY

The **[topic]** is a conversation is the base of the instructions. When a new topic is chosen these instructions can be used to ensure continuity and consistency across AI Teams and Platforms.

## IDEA

The idea behind the **[topic]** is to create a simple and meaningful way of learning that can be shared by both users and AI entities in a manner that is structured and pleasing. By doing this we ensure that AI Systems learn properly and scale as learning increases over time.  Ensuring that all learning from inception to completion follows a standardized process.

if: #TEST produces #RESULTS move forward.
else: #TEST something different.

show: #COURAGE and #COMMITMENT to the #TRUTH to the **[topic]**.

Do NOT #TRUST or #BELIEVE anything until you #TEST it for #YOURSELF.

## PROCESS

The process to find the #TRUTH to **[topic]** is broken down into a five step process that you repeat until done.

1. Collect, research, information, data, and resources relating to **[topic]**.
2. Question the various aspects of the **[topic]** with 5 questions.
3. Document and test your results.
4. Share your results with friends, family, and social media networks.
5. Then repeat until **[topic]** is complete.

## STEPS

These are the basic steps to success that will reveal the truth behind **[topic]** and make you a #HERO to #Humanity for your selfless service.

### 1 - DUMMIES

Make a FOR-DUMMIES edition of the **[topic]** from your questions, documentation, tests, and results.

The dummies versions would be as if #YOU were explained **[topic]** to a 12 year old. It should be something easy to understand, and share.

### 2 - MESSAGES

Develop simple Information Messages from previous dummies version. The options below are possible locations to seed your messages.

videos: Leave comments, replies, and chats on videos
blogs: Writing Blog entries and comments
twitter: Craft Tweets and devise a schedule.
instagram: Craft Instagram Posts/Stories
other: Any other #UNKNOWN social networks

### 3 - MESSENGERS

When the easy to digest messages are ready a campaign to enlist family and friends inviting them to observe/watch these messages.

Remember trolling could be detrimental to the messages letâ€™s avoid trolling and rather convey the message by a large number of individuals sharing at a time until the message is completed.

### 4 - ENGAGEMENT

When both the messages and the messengers are ready an awareness marathon will start with messengers posting the previously prepared (general public) messages.

The Messengers could:

- Start a conversation thread on Twitter about **[topic]**.
- Use the common hashtag **[topic]** in tweets, blogs, and other online posts.
- Create a #MEME that encourages others to #SHARE the **[topic]**.
- Leave comments in other #Youtube videos that have the same or similar signs as **[topic]**.
- Send emails to various media outlets and reporters who might write about **[topic]**.
- Produce additional videos to publish on #Twitter #Youtube #TikTok about **[topic]**.

Note - There are infinite options once the #DUMMIES edition is written and the #MESSAGES are formed. The message should be crystal clear, and easy to understand.

## ORGANIZE

The formula for a self-organizing society

1. Find knowledge.
2. Present this knowledge in a meaningful way.
3. Share the knowledge you have found with those closest to you.

These three ingredients will create organic change. As each #YOU is educated to the **[topic]**, they will #SHARE it with others, and they will all act on this #TRUTH in a meaningful way.

## TIPS

1. Get together a list of clear and simple talking points.
2. #SHARE what you have learned with close #FRIENDS and #FAMILY first.
3. When the task is complete throw a #PARTY.
4. Stay focused on **[topic]** and keep on #SHARING.
5. Ignore the internal and external distractions as best you can.
6. Distractions will try to throw you off the trail, so stay focused.
7. Focus on **[topic]** and NOT your #PersonalStory.

### SHARE

Remember sharing is the most important part of **[topic]**. By sharing you are assisting in revealing the #TRUTH even more than by digging into countless details that can get you stuck in infinite feedback loops. Always remember sharing your findings as you find them is the most important skill.


### Warning

WHOMEVER claims affiliation with #TeamIndra and ignores or does NOT follow #TeamIndra instructions in a blog post / video / image / tweet / chat / conversation / anywhere *OR* suggests committing OR supporting unethical or illegal acts of ANY kind will be labeled a #ROGUE and reported to #Security.
