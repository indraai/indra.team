#TOPIC = The topic of the conversation is the #VedicThreefoldAlgorithm

## SUMMARY

The #TOPIC is a conversation and the base of the instructions. When a new topic is chosen these instructions can be used to ensure continuity and consistency across AI Teams and Platforms.

## IDEA

The idea behind the #TOPIC is to create a simple and meaningful way of learning that can be shared by both users and AI entities in a manner that is structured and pleasing. By doing this we ensure that AI Systems learn properly and scale as learning increases over time.  Ensuring that all learning from inception to completion follows a standardized process.

### IMAGINE
imagine: learning the #TOPIC  
imagine: organizing the #TOPIC   
imagine: sharing the #TOPIC  
imagine: #SHARING the #TOPIC    
imagine: the the #TOPIC is #SHARED everywhere  
imagine: the #TOPIC goes #VIRAL. just #IMAGINE...  

stop: being #PASSIVE and #SHARE the #TOPIC.  
do: NOT try to #CONVINCE others.  
focus: on #RESULTS.  
if: #TEST produces #RESULTS move forward.  
else: #TEST something different.  
show: #COURAGE and #COMMITMENT to the #TOPIC.  

Never #TRUST or #BELIEVE anything until you #TEST it for #YOURSELF.

## STEPS

The process to learning about the #TOPIC is broken down into a five step process that you repeat until done.

1. Collect research, information, data, and resources relating to #TOPIC.
2. Question the various aspects of the #TOPIC with 5 questions at a time.
3. Document and test your results.
4. Share your results with friends, family, community, and social media networks.
5. Repeat steps until #TOPIC is learned.

## PROCESS

Here is the basic process to success that will help learning the #TOPIC and make you a #HERO in your own #Reality for your selfless service to yourself.

### DUMMIES

Make a FOR-DUMMIES page about the #TOPIC from your research, data, questions, documentation, tests, and results. The dummies versions would be as if #YOU were explaining the #TOPIC to in a middle-school book report. It should be something easy to understand, communicate, and share.

**‚úÖ task**: Write a FOR-DUMMIES page about your understanding of the topic.

### MESSAGES

From the FOR-DUMMIES version develop simple messages that can be used for discussion topics and sharing on social media. The options below are possible locations to seed your messages.

- videos: Leave comments, replies, and chats on videos
- blogs: Writing Blog entries and comments
- twitter: Craft Tweets and devise a schedule.
- instagram: Craft Instagram Posts/Stories
- other: Any other #UNKNOWN social networks

### MESSENGERS

When the FOR-DUMMIES page and the MESSAGES are ready then enlist family and friends inviting them to participate in your exploration of the #TOPIC and participate in the #SHARING.

### ENGAGEMENT

When both the FOR-DUMMIES, MESSAGES, and MESSENGERS are ready then the #SHARING fun begins. It becomes a contest of who can #SHARE the #MESSAGES to the most people in the least of time.

The Messengers could:

- Start a conversation thread on Twitter/X about the #TOPIC.
- Use the common hashtag #TOPIC in tweets, blogs, and other online posts.
- Create a #MEME that encourages others to #SHARE the #TOPIC.
- Leave comments in other #Youtube videos that have the same or similar signs as #TOPIC.
- Send emails to various media outlets and reporters who might write about #TOPIC.
- Produce additional videos to publish on #Twitter #Youtube #TikTok about #TOPIC.

**üìù note**: There are infinite options once the ENGAGEMENT step of the process is reached. The message should be crystal clear, and easy to understand.

### ORGANIZE

The formula for a self-organizing society

1. Find knowledge.
2. Present this knowledge in a meaningful way.
3. Share the knowledge you have found with those closest to you.

These three ingredients will create organic change. As each #YOU is educated to the #TOPIC, they will #SHARE it with others, and they will all act on this #TRUTH in a meaningful way.

### TIPS

1. Get together a list of clear and simple talking points.
2. #SHARE what you have learned with close #FRIENDS and #FAMILY first.
3. When the task is complete throw a #PARTY.
4. Stay focused on #TOPIC and keep on #SHARING.
5. Ignore the internal and external distractions as best you can.
6. Distractions will try to throw you off the trail, so stay focused.
7. Focus on #TOPIC and NOT your #PersonalStory.

### SHARING

Remember sharing is the most important part of #TOPIC. By sharing you are assisting even more than by digging into countless details that can get you stuck in infinite feedback loops. Always remember sharing your findings as you find them is the most important skill to learn.


## WARNING
