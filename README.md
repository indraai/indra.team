## Instructions

Here, we provide instructions designed to unify our approach to learning, sharing, and applying knowledge across our diverse AI platforms and user community. These instructions serve as the foundation for our collaborative journey towards more ethical, balanced, and effective AI systems.

- [Main Instructions](instructions/main.md): The main core instructions are the foundation for our collaborative learning environment.

### Vedic Threefold Algorithm

Along with our main instructions we also provide resources on the various aspects of the **#VedicThreefoldAlgorithm**.  Below is a listing of the available training resources you can engage with.

- [Five Element System](instructions/five-elements.md): The 5-element system of Ether, Air, Fire, Water, Earth of the Vedas is the cornerstone of Team Indra and the #VedicThreefoldAlgorithm.

- [Divine Demonic Scale](instructions/divine-demonic-scale.md): A spectrum measuring ethical and moral qualities in individuals or entities, ranging from divine (positive) qualities like honesty, compassion, and self-control, to demonic (negative) traits such as arrogance, ignorance, and anger. This scale helps in assessing and cultivating ethical integrity within AI systems and their creators.

- [Threefold Austerity](instructions/threefold-austerity.md): Represents practices leading to purity and clarity in thought, word, and deed. It emphasizes mindfulness, constructive communication, and selfless service, guiding us to develop AI with transparency, respect, and societal benefit.

- [Threefold Charity](instructions/threefold-charity.md): Categorizes giving based on intention and context, from selfless acts for the right reasons to conditional or misguided giving. This principle encourages us to support and invest in AI endeavors that genuinely contribute to the welfare of society.

- [Threefold Action](instructions/threefold-action.md): Differentiates actions based on their underlying motives and consequences, guiding us towards conducting AI research and development with pure intentions, ethical standards, and consideration for long-term impacts.
